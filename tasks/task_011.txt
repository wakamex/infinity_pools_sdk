# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Tenderly Impersonation for Account Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the SDK with Tenderly impersonation capabilities to enable testing with real user accounts without requiring private keys, specifically supporting account 0x9eAFc0c2b04D96a1C1edAdda8A474a4506752207.
# Details:
This task involves several key implementation steps:

1. Extend the TenderlyFork class to support account impersonation:
   - Add methods to impersonate accounts using Tenderly's API
   - Implement functionality to manage impersonation state
   - Create helper methods to simplify impersonation setup and teardown

2. Develop methods to create impersonated Web3 instances:
   - Create factory methods that return Web3 instances configured for impersonation
   - Ensure proper middleware configuration for impersonated transactions
   - Handle authentication and authorization with Tenderly's API

3. Update InfinityPoolsConnector for impersonation support:
   - Add support for custom HTTP headers required by Tenderly
   - Implement methods to handle impersonated account interactions
   - Ensure compatibility with existing connector functionality

4. Implement proper error handling:
   - Create specific exception types for impersonation failures
   - Add validation for impersonation parameters
   - Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

5. Create comprehensive documentation:
   - Document all new methods and parameters
   - Provide usage examples for impersonation functionality
   - Include explanations of Tenderly-specific concepts and requirements

The implementation should prioritize a clean, intuitive API that makes impersonation straightforward while handling the complexity of Tenderly's requirements internally.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will verify the complete impersonation functionality through multiple approaches:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test TenderlyFork impersonation methods with mocked Tenderly API responses
   - Verify proper handling of successful and failed impersonation attempts
   - Test error handling for various edge cases (invalid addresses, API failures)

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create test fixtures that demonstrate impersonation setup
   - Implement tests that use impersonated accounts to interact with contracts
   - Verify that transactions from impersonated accounts are properly processed

3. Specific Account Testing:
   - Create dedicated tests using the specified account (0x9eAFc0c2b04D96a1C1edAdda8A474a4506752207)
   - Verify that all SDK functionality works correctly with this impersonated account
   - Test various contract interactions using the impersonated account

4. End-to-End Workflow Tests:
   - Create tests that demonstrate complete workflows using impersonation
   - Test switching between different impersonated accounts
   - Verify that impersonation works with all existing SDK functionality

5. Documentation Verification:
   - Review and test all code examples in documentation
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects implementation
   - Verify that error messages match documentation

All tests should be automated and included in the CI pipeline to ensure ongoing functionality.
