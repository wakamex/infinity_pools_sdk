# Task ID: 12
# Title: Task #12: Develop Functional Test Framework with Tenderly Impersonation for SDK
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive functional test framework that leverages Tenderly impersonation to test SDK functions with real accounts, without requiring private keys.
# Details:
This task involves building a robust functional test framework for the SDK using Tenderly impersonation capabilities implemented in Task #11. The implementation should include:

1. Create a base functional test class (e.g., `BaseFunctionalTest`) that provides:
   - Common setup and teardown methods
   - Fixtures for Tenderly impersonation
   - Utilities for account management and transaction verification
   - Helper methods for common assertions and validations
   - Configuration handling for test environments

2. Implement functional tests for `add_liquidity`:
   - Test various liquidity addition scenarios with different parameters
   - Verify token transfers and position updates
   - Test edge cases including min/max tick ranges
   - Handle both new position creation and existing position expansion

3. Implement functional tests for `remove_liquidity`:
   - Test partial and complete liquidity removal
   - Verify correct token amounts returned
   - Test across different position configurations
   - Validate position state after removal

4. Set up extensible test structure for additional SDK functions:
   - Create test class templates for `collect_fees`, `swap_exact_input`, `swap_exact_output`, `get_position_details`, and `get_pool_info`
   - Implement shared test utilities that can be reused across function tests
   - Design parameterized test cases that can handle various input configurations

5. Configure test runner integration:
   - Implement a mechanism to run tests with the `--run-integration` flag
   - Ensure tests can be run in isolation or as part of a full test suite
   - Add proper logging and reporting for test results

The implementation should follow best practices for test organization, including proper setup/teardown, clear test case naming, and comprehensive assertions. Tests should be designed to be maintainable and extensible as the SDK evolves.

# Test Strategy:
The test strategy for this task should include:

1. Code Review:
   - Verify the base test class implements all required utilities and fixtures
   - Ensure test organization follows best practices and is maintainable
   - Check that Tenderly impersonation is properly integrated
   - Confirm test coverage for various scenarios and edge cases

2. Unit Testing:
   - Run individual test cases to verify they correctly test specific SDK functions
   - Validate that test assertions properly check expected outcomes
   - Ensure test utilities function as expected

3. Integration Testing:
   - Run the full test suite with the `--run-integration` flag
   - Verify tests successfully impersonate the specified account (0x9eAFc0c2b04D96a1C1edAdda8A474a4506752207)
   - Confirm tests interact with actual contracts on the blockchain
   - Validate that all SDK functions are tested with real-world scenarios

4. Validation Criteria:
   - All tests should pass consistently when run with the integration flag
   - Test coverage should meet or exceed 90% for the SDK functions being tested
   - Tests should complete within a reasonable time frame (< 5 minutes for the full suite)
   - Test reports should provide clear information about test results and any failures

5. Documentation:
   - Verify that the test framework is well-documented with usage examples
   - Ensure comments explain test scenarios and expected outcomes
   - Confirm README includes instructions for running tests with the integration flag

The implementation will be considered complete when all tests pass consistently, provide adequate coverage, and follow the specified structure for extensibility.
